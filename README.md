# Objective
In order to improve my skills and do some exercises on data analytics, I've started analyzing Apple Stock Dataset that I've got it from Kaggle. The dataset is related to stock trading on Apple from 1980 to 2025. Each record represents a trading day along with the prices and volume. This dataset provides historical data of APPLE INC. stock (AAPL). The data is available at a daily level. Currency is USD. The dataset consists of 11107 records and 7 columns along with outlier values, wrong entries and different price formats that I found it later as I analyzed it in detail. I am planning to use Excel, Python and PowerBI to analyze, implement ML algorithms on dataset and visualize all of the things related to dataset. 

# Columns
* Date : Represents trading day.
* Open : Price from the first transaction of a trading day
* High : Maximum price in a trading day
* Low : Minimum price in a trading day
* Close : Price from the last transaction of a trading day
* Adj Close : Closing price adjusted to reflect the value after accounting for any corporate actions
* Volume : Number of units traded in a day.
